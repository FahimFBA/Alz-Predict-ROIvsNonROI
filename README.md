# Efficient Prediction for Alzheimer's Disease

## Short Demonstration
This project leverages advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the automated segmentation and analysis of MRI brain images to detect Alzheimer's Disease. We use 3D ResNet enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve the model's performance and interpretability. Our approach includes data preprocessing, MRI registration, and data augmentation techniques. The dataset is sourced from ADNI and OASIS, segmented using FastSurfer, and processed with CLAHE for better contrast. This method aims for accurate and efficient Alzheimer's detection, enhancing early diagnosis and treatment strategies.

## Abstract



## Datasets
In the first phase, we gathered 3D MRI datasets from ADNI and OASIS, renowned initiatives for advancing the understanding of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. We categorized the data into Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. Additionally, we obtained CSV files containing detailed patient information for labeling. Strict privacy rules were followed to ensure the security of sensitive medical data.

## Dataset Organization
For our research, we categorized the dataset into three distinct groups: AD (Alzheimer's Disease), CN (Cognitively Normal), and MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment).

### ADNI 
We utilized the ADNI Screening 1.5T dataset, which includes subjects who underwent a screening scan. We collected Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) images from 2294 subjects.

### OASIS
The dataset includes 416 patients aged 18 to 96. Each person undergoes three or four T1-weighted MRI scans in a single session. Among the participants over sixty, 100 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, there is a reliability dataset with 20 nondemented participants.

## Recreating the Conda Environment for this Project

This repository includes files to help you recreate the development environment used in this project. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment on your local machine.

### Files Included
- **`environment.yml`**: Captures the full Conda environment, including both Conda and pip-installed packages.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists only pip-installed packages, useful for users who prefer pip-based installations.

---

### 1. Recreate the Conda Environment

#### Prerequisites
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

#### Steps
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
3. Activate the newly created environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate fydp-old
   ```
4. Verify the environment:
   ```bash
   conda list
   ```

---

### 2. Using the `requirements.txt` File (Pip-Only Option)

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python and `pip` are installed on your system.

#### Steps
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

---

### Notes
- **Preferred Method**: The `environment.yml` file is recommended as it fully captures both Conda and pip-installed packages, ensuring 100% reproducibility.
- **Pip Limitation**: The `requirements.txt` file only includes pip-installed packages and may not recreate Conda-specific dependencies or system-level requirements.
